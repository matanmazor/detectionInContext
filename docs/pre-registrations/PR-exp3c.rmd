# Motivation

In previous two experiment, participants performed a letter detection task, where on different trials the target letter (e.g., 'S') was sometimes congruent and sometimes incongruent with a context word (for example, S is congruent with KI_S, but incongruent with FL_G). As expected, decisions about letter absence were overall slower than decisions about letter presence. Furthermore, subjects more readily detected the presence of a letter when the context was congruent, compared to incongruent with the target letter. However, we found no effect of context congruency on the time taken to infer the absence of a target. Specifically, subjects did not infer absence earlier in a congruent context although they could have safely done so without increasing their miss rate. 

In this Experiment, we test whether this finding is due to subjects not having metacognitive access into the effects of context on perception, or alternatively, due to a more general difficulty with adjusting a decision criterion between trials [@gorea2000failure]. To achieve this, we incorporate a manipulation whose effect on detection difficulty should be obvious to participants: hiding parts of the stimulus. 


# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. Changes relative to Exp. 2 appear in **bold letters**.<!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Participants

The research complies with all relevant ethical regulations, and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Birkbeck, University of London (study ID number 1812000). Participants will be recruited via Prolific, and will give informed consent prior to their participation. To be eligible to take part in this study, their Prolific approval rate will need to be 95% or higher, their reported first language English, and their age between 18 and 60. We will  collect data until we reach **250** included participants (after applying our pre-registered exclusion criteria). The entire experiment will take 10 minutes to complete. Participants will be paid £1.35 for their participation, equivalent to an hourly wage of £8.1.

## Procedure

Participants will detect the presence or absence of a target letter (S or A, in different blocks) in a patch of dynamic grayscale noise presented at 15 frames per second. In each frame, noise will be generated by randomly sampling grayscale values from a target image $I$. Specifically, for each pixel $S_{ij}$, we will display the grayscale value for the corresponding pixel in the original image $I_{ij}$ with some probability $p$, and the grayscale value of a randomly chosen pixel $I_{i'j'}$ with probability $1-p$. On target-absent trials, $p$ will be set to $0$, such that they grayscale values of all pixels will be randomly shuffled. On target-present trials, $p$ will be calibrated online to achieve performance levels of around 80%, following a 1-up-3-down procedure, starting at $v=0.2$ and following a multiplicative set size of $0.9$, which will move closer to 1 following each change direction in the calibration process, with a reset to $0.9$ after the second block, to allow separate staircasing for each letter. Responses will be delivered using the F and G keyboard keys, and response-mapping will be counterbalanced across subjects.

Bottom right: overall experiment structure. ", out.width = '75%'}

```

After reading the instructions, participants will complete four practice trials. In case their accuracy in these four practice trials falls below 3/4, they will be reminded of task instructions and given additional practice trials, until they reach the desired accuracy level. Otherwise, they will continue to the main part of the experiment. Here, their task will be exactly the same, but a fixed proportion of pixels (5% or 15%, on different trials within the same block; see Fig. \@ref(fig:design)) will be occluded by black pixels. Unlike Exp. 1 and 2, no other images or letters will appear on the screen. 

The main part of the experiment will comprise four blocks of 16 trials. For approximately half of the participants, in blocks 1 and 2 the target letter will be S and in blocks 3 and 4 it will be A. The order of letters will be reversed for the other half. 

### Randomization

The order and timing of experimental events, as well as the luminance values of pixels within a trial, will be determined pseudo-randomly by the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator, initialized in a way that ensures registration time-locking [@mazor2018novel]. 

## Data analysis

### Rejection criteria

Participants will be excluded if their accuracy falls below 50%. We will also exclude participants for having extremely fast or slow reaction times in one or more of the tasks (below 100 milliseconds or above 5 seconds in more than 25% of the trials). 

Trials with response time below 100 milliseconds or above 5 seconds will be excluded from the response-time analysis.

### Hypotheses and analysis plan

This study is designed to test the timing of decisions to terminate evidence accumulation in the absence of a target as a function of stimulus occlusion.

*Hypothesis 1 (PRESENCE/ABSENCE RESPONSE TIME)*: We will test the null hypothesis that response times are similar for target-absent and target-present responses, aiming to replicate the finding that decisions about the absence of a target are slower than decisions about its presence [@mazor2021metacognitive; @mazor2020distinct]. This will be tested using a paired t-test on the median individual level-response times. 

*Hypothesis 2 (OCCLUSION EFFECT IN PRESENCE)*: We will test the null hypothesis that target-present response times are similar when 5% or 10% of the pixels are occluded. This will be tested using a paired t-test on the median individual level-response times in correct trials only.

*Hypothesis 3 (OCCLUSION EFFECT IN ABSENCE)*: We will test the null hypothesis that response times in target-absent responses are similar when 5% or 10% of the pixels are occluded. This will be tested using a paired t-test on the median individual level-response times in correct trials only.

*Hypothesis 4 (OCCLUSION RESPONSE INTERACTION)*: We will test the null hypothesis that the effect of occlusion on reaction time is similar in target-absent and target-present responses. This will be tested by performing a group-level t-test on the subject-level contrast $(median(RT_{P,5\%})-median(RT_{P,10\%}))-(median(RT_{A,5\%})-median(RT_{A,10\%}))$ Where $P$ and $A$ stand for present and absent, and 5% and 10% represent the proportion of hidden pixels. Here too, analysis will be restricted to correct trials only.

*Hypothesis 5 (SENSITIVITY)*: We will test the null hypothesis that perceptual sensitivity (measured as $d'=z(H)-z(F)$) is equal as a function of the proportion of hidden pixels. To allow the extraction of d' for participants who committed no false-alarms or misses, we will add 0.5 to miss, hit, false-alarm and correct rejection counts [@snodgrass1988pragmatics].

*Hypothesis 6 (CRITERION)*: We will test the null hypothesis that decision criterion (measured as $c=-0.5(z(H)+z(F))$) is unaffected by the proportion of hidden pixels. To allow the extraction of a decision criterion for participants who committed no false-alarms or misses, we will add 0.5 to miss, hit, false-alarm and correct rejection counts [@snodgrass1988pragmatics].


## Sample size justification

In Exp. 2, stansardized effect sizes for Hypotheses 2 (effect of context congruency on RT in target-present trials) and 4 (interaction between context congruency and target presence with respect to RT) were $0.38$ and $0.25$, respectively. Since our focus is on the corresponding effects of pixel occlusion, we decided to test enough participants to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect an effect of 0.25 s.d.. With 250 participants, we will have a statistical power of 98% to detect effect sizes of $0.25$ standard deviations.
