## Rationale for occluded visual search task (2022-01-04)

In Exp. 3 (occluded detection), subjects did not adjust their target-absent decision times based on expected search difficulty. Although they took longer to detect the target when more of the image was occluded, the proportion of occluded pixels had no effect on the time it took them to infer absence. This finding is surprising, because subjects should know that detecting a target is harder when more of the visual field is occluded, and so they should be more conservative in detecting absence in such circumstances.

One potential explanation is that people never adjust the timing of their decisions about absence based on the expected visibility of the target. For example, @gorea2000 found that subjects fail to simultaneously hold in working memory two separate detection criteria for concurrent detection tasks. Interestingly, in visual search tasks, subjects flexibly adjust their search termination heuristic between trials as a function of set size and the expected salience of the target [@mazor2022]. In visual search, manipulations that affect search time in target-present trials only are relatively rare. Together, it seems that subjects struggle to use metacognitive inference ("I would have seen it by now") in a detection setting, but not in a visual search setting.

One possible explanation is that metacognitive knowledge about attention and perception is not represented in units of time (e.g., "finding the item would take me 2 seconds") but in units of attention allocation steps instead (e.g., "finding the item would take me 20 saccades"). As a result, metacognitive stopping can only occur in tasks where subjects actively allocate attention to different sources.

To test this possibility directly, we can repeat Exp. 3, but this time the target can appear or not in one of several (e.g., 4) different locations. Maybe it can look something like this (just a rough sketch):

```{r design-vs, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/occludedSearchSketch.png")
```

If we now find that the proportion of occluded pixels does have an effect on search time in target-absent trials, this lends some support to the idea that people are tracking something other than time in making decisions about target absence.

## An issue with the experiment code (2022-01-06)

In all versions of the experiment I ran so far, there were two jatos.onLoad commands, and cryptographic pre-registration only happened in the second one. I ran some tests and all subjects were run with the correct version of the onLoad function, because we have 100 unique subject sums in Exp. 1, 323 in Exp. 2, and 253 in Exp. 3: the same as the number of participants. I also checked and the setting of the randomization seed affects the contents of the experiment, even if this setting only appears in the second function. This bug, which did not affect the data, will be fixed in all following experiments.

## Results of the pilot experiment (2022-01-06)

I ran 30 participants on a version of the occlusion task where the target letter can appear anywhere within an array. I manipulated the size of the array (24x24 or 32x32 pixels) and the proportion of occluded pixels (5% or 15%).

Even within the context of visual search, there is no effect of the proportion of occluded pixels on "target-absent" response times. Oddly, the effect in target-present response times does not interact with array size, and the effect of array size on target-absent response times is smaller, instead of larger, than its effect in target-absent response times.

Maybe a model that can explain these results is:

While t\<noisy timer: - sample a random location - run a drift diffusion model until the target is found or until reaching the time limit per fixation. - if target is found, respond yes - otherwise, repeat.

Say no.

This explains why there should be an effect of occlusion in target presence (effect on drift rate) but not in target absence (no effect on drift rate for absence), why there is no interaction between the effects of occlusion and array size in target present (the effect of occlusion is only via the last fixated location).

This model fails to explain, however, the effect of array size on search time, and the fact that this effect seems weaker rather than stronger in target-absent trials.

## Results of the pilot experiment - moving occluders (2022-01-20)

I ran a pilot experiment where the occluders move on the display, with the purpose of revealing a setting where target-present and target-absent trials behave similarly (that is, both show a cost for occluding more of the screen). With 30 participants, there is no significant effect for either target-present or target-absent response times (analysis/movingOccluders.Rmd). Instead, there is a strong effect on decision accuracy, where participants miss more targets when more of the display is occluded. Seems like an effect of both d-prime and criterion.

## Fewer unique accuracy values in Exp. 3 (2022-02-03)

I was surprised that there were fewer unique accuracy values per condition and target presence in Exp. 3 than in Exp. 2. The reason is that in Exp. 1 and 2 different subjects had different numbers of target-present congruent and incongruent trials, because they were randomized independently. In Exp. 3 they were randomized together.

## New pilot experiment - Row occluders + confidence (2022-03-09)

I launched a new version of the experiment, where entire rows are occluded, and subjects rate their confidence in the second block. The results are like the other occlusion experiment. Confidence in absence is affected by the row manipulation, but RT isn't.

## DDM simulations (2022-04-21)

I simulated different version of the DDM model, with an attempt to reproduce the qualitative behavioural effects (presence responses are slower, errors are slower in both yes and no responses, and the variability in target-absent response times is higher than that of target-present response times).

Two models manage to reproduce these patterns, without the variability effect. One where drift rate is samples from $N(0.5,0.5)$ for target-present trials and $N(-0.5,0.5)$ for target absent trials. The starting point is closer to the upper boundary ($z=0.5$, $a=1.5$). This model reproduces the qualitative mean differences in RT, but not differences in spread. The second model assumes drift rate is 0 for target-absent and positive (0.5) for target-present with a collapsing boundary that starts collapsing sharply after a second. This model produces the qualitative mean differences in RT, as well as the differences in variability.

I also tried a model where the number of accumulators \>1, and where "target-present" decisions can be triggered by one accumulator reaching the upper boundary, but "target-absent" decisions are only triggered when all accumulators reach the lower boundary. I couldn't find a set of parameters for which this model reproduces the qualitative pattern.

## Confidence in absence (2022-05-17)

I feel like I reached a dead end with my attempts to come up with a reasonable evidence accumulation model, so leaving this aside for now. Instead, I thought we can focus on the fact that Exp. 4 found evidence of a difference in mean confidence in absence as a function of occlusion. We can then ask whether a similar difference will be found for context effects.
